  courseDescription:
    "This course is well-designed to give kids and teens a comprehensive exposure to the beautiful language of the Igbos from basics to being able to hold conversations with family and friends.\nIn Part I (Introduction): Kids learn to identify, write, and pronounce all the Igbo alphabets using them to form simple words. They'll also learn how to greet, how to address family members in Igbo, and how to identify as well as count numbers from One to Fifty using the Igbo Language. They'll develop a love for the language, and undergo an assessment at the end to solidify what they've learned!\nIn Part 2 (Intermediate): Kids will learn how to introduce themselves and initiate conversations with simple sentences. We'll also learn about body parts, common objects, and naming nouns they come across every day to help enrich their Igbo vocabulary. Because numbers are important to us as Igbos, we'll revisit numbers and learn from Fifty to One Hundred!\nIn Part 3 (Advanced): Here, kids will learn about the culture and history of the Igbo People. They'll learn about the days of the week, time, and historical market days, as well as hold longer conversations in Igbo. We'll study some Igbo Proverbs, Foods, Dressing, etc, and examine the meaning of historical places in Eastern Nigeria to help students better connect with the native Igbo Language.\nGeneral class activities: Dialogues, Demonstrations, Practice, Songs, etc.\nLearning materials provided: Textbooks, Diagrams, Images, etc.",

    "The Easy Way to Start Speaking Igbo Language for Adult Learners",
  courseSubtitle: "Conversational Igbo Lessons",
  courseBrief:
    "This two-part course is specifically designed to give you confidence and fluency to communicate effectively in Igbo language with friends and family in 2 months. It starts from the basics and simultaneously increases your proficiency in Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing Igbo - with special emphasis on having conversations.",
  courseDescription:
    "The easiest way to learn how to speak the Igbo language, especially as an adult, is not by learning all the lexical constructs and mechanics that form the language, but rather by mastering the correct pronunciation of the alphabets, how they form words, what those words mean and then extensively practicing in conversations with a native speaker - and that is what this course offers!\nWe begin with a foundation in the Igbo Alphabets which helps you pronounce them correctly, and form simple words using the right intonation. We'll cover Greetings and Salutations which are the basis for communication and learn how to address family members, colleagues, etc. Numbers help you count and discuss money ;). You'll be able to introduce yourself formally and informally, common objects, nouns, and pronouns you often come across to help enrich your Igbo vocabulary as we progress from simple to complex conversations.\nWe'll also learn about Verbs, Adjectives, and Conjunctions used in forming complex sentences in Igbo. Some lessons are dedicated to practicing and having discussions in class with other students and the teacher. We'll answer questions, practice together, and share resources to help you converse fluently in Igbo.",

We've helped thousands of students pass IELTS with many scoring 8.0 - 9.0 in Reading and Writing including first-timers and those re-taking the test. We'll want to show you how. Join this Masterclass now and pass IELTS once and for all.",
  courseDescription:
    "The IELTS Reading and Writing modules are quite challenging for most students. The Writing test is designed to assess how you write a response appropriately, organise ideas and use a range of vocabulary and grammar accurately and the main aim of the reading test is to judge how good you are at understanding written English.\nIt is certainly not enough that you know how to read, not enough to have skills to understand what the passages talk about. The challenging part lies in identifying the right answers and this requires a special set of skills. Skills you will master in this class. Same goes with the writing test. Even native speakers make mistakes in punctuation, spelling, and grammar. We do it all the time. However, for the IELTS writing exam, there are certain criteria you must fulfill in order to get a good band score.\nBefore you read on, note that this 2-days Masterclass is specifically for those who have taken the test in the past and those who have their exam approaching but are not confident in their Reading and Writing skills. If you fall within this category, this Masterclass is going to be a life-changer for you and we guarantee you'll watch your scores significantly go up.\nThis Masterclass curriculum is structured to ensure that you are well prepared for the kinds of questions you'll be asked and how the IELTS examiners expect you to respond in order to pass the test and achieve an 8.0 band. It covers the Reading and Writing modules extensively with in-depth techniques taught by well-seasoned teachers. All students undertake a diagnostic test which helps us understand your strengths and weakness, as well as a standard IELTS Reading & Writing mock exam covering both modules towards the end of the class.\nJoin now before the class fills up.",

            "Ryan’s surfing lesson was amazing! He definitely has a passion & knowledge for the sport and he and Amanda were by our sides guiding us the whole time. I got to stand up on a surfboard on a wave within the hour! That was far beyond what I expected! I would definitely book with Ryan again if I go back to South Padre. Thank you both!!",

I caught a lot of waves, had a great time, and felt inspired to continue surfing. I highly recommend this experience to anyone like me who has always wanted to surf but unsure how to get started. Surfvive can get you there.",
