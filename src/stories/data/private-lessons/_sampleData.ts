          "My first student came to me because he heard me speaking in the corridor at my workplace. He wasn't sure what he needed but he surely knew he wanted to improve his German. He wanted to be able to speak up in class and also excel in his studies when he finally moves abroad. \n\nI learnt how to speak German in Germany. I understand that it is harder if you are outside of the country and of course everyday life circumstances comes in between.\n\nI would like to bridge that gap for you. If you are already experienced with the German Language we will only speak German. If you are a fresher I am glad to switch in between. Whatever works best for you to become better in the Language.\n\nI enjoy conversing. Talking about your everyday life and why you are learning German because at the end of the day all this is necessary to describe your experiences to others speaking the language.",

          "I am an experienced teacher of mathematics and have been grooming students to love/appreciate numbers, making them learn maths and other numeric skills passionately. I teach by first of all making students to understand that mathematics is the simplest subject because it deals with facts and has a pattern, which could be logic oriented, formula or our common day to day examples of numbers, items and countable transactions. With this, they are always relaxed and secondly I understand the problem areas in the subject so I know the exact weak areas children face and I hit it squarely by throwing questions in those areas, giving assignments and responding to that by a way of assessment.\n\nIn fact, NewHall Internaational School Chevron, Lekki, where I teach, organizes after class periods for some average pupils, my participation in that class has been having a positive multiplier effect as my pupils/students record tremendous improvements which far outweighs past numeric abilities.\n\nFinally, I teach by connecting the known with what is not yet known to the students, this enables them to understand better any explanation. Also as a Montessori/IGCSE trained teacher I adopt numerous teaching methods that befits different learning categories. This has been giving me the desired results expected.",

          "Dear Client,\n\nThank you for visiting my profile. Here are a few reasons why I'm the best available hand for your ward:\n\n1. General Mathematics teaches more than mere calculations, but equally, help students to develop analytical minds. If this is not gotten right at this level, a not so smart adult may result. Hence, it is important that an experienced and patient Tutor who will deploy an illustrative mode of teaching, to ensure that it is not only understood but enjoyed by the student. Having taught this for at least 3years at basic school level(primary and secondary), I believe I'm more than qualify to deliver.\n\n2. Not only have I taught for 3years, but I have also been able to achieve impressive results with my students. One of such is the Mosunmola who moved from hating Mathematics to loving it, and eventually had an A in Junior WAEC, after her parents had given up on her poor run of form in the subject.\n\n3. My relationship with my students goes beyond a pen and notepad. I do ensure that I become their friends, this makes me approachable, so they can easily inquire of me when they are having difficulty understanding what they are being taught. I deploy illustrative analogies to aid the learning process of my pupils and make the atmosphere less tense and friendly.",

I use modern teaching aids and techniques when tutoring my students, and also relate each concept to their daily experiences so they can understand and retain the knowledge better.\n\nI teach the major subjects for Years 1-6 such as English Language, Quantitatives, Mathematics, Creative & Letter Writing, Verbal Reasoning, ICT etc., as well as coach students in preparation for Common Entrance and secondary school exams, and have recorded great successes. In teaching young learners, I try to understand how best they learn and then tailor the lessons to suit them, while making emphasis on areas they may not have thoroughly understood.\n\nI am passionate about teaching. I strive to help my students master their numeracy, reasoning and vocabulary, including written and spoken English which are very important parts of training a pupil/student into a creative, analytical and responsible adult capable of self-sustained continuous learning. That's my joy as a teacher currently teaching at Lagoons.",

My second class upper background in Actuarial Science has proffered me the relevant skills to handle Elementary Mathematics effective across nursery and primary classes.\n\n2. I take my time to understand the strengths and weaknesses of my students and strategically formulate means to tackle them. I'm a distinction student and I can handle all levels of students. I have over the years built capacities and transformed students individually and helped to reach their goals.\n\n3. I like to teach in a serene environment that allows easy flow of information. I'm a proficient data analyst and computer literate. I have over the years adapt myself with recent technological trend in both local and international examinations. I give all my lectures off hand as a demonstration of strength to my students which has over the years made them better with the thought of emulating such.",

          "I have over 6 years professional experience teaching students in lower and upper primary classes, as well as junior and senior secondary classes. I use modern teaching aids and techniques when tutoring my students, and also relate each concept to their daily experiences so they can understand and retain the knowledge better.\n\nI teach the major subjects for Years 1-6 such as English Language, Quantitatives, Mathematics, Creative & Letter Writing, Verbal Reasoning, ICT etc., as well as coach students in preparation for Common Entrance and secondary school exams, and have recorded great successes. In teaching young learners, I try to understand how best they learn and then tailor the lessons to suit them, while making emphasis on areas they may not have thoroughly understood.\n\nI am passionate about teaching. I strive to help my students master their numeracy, reasoning and vocabulary, including written and spoken English which are very important parts of training a pupil/student into a creative, analytical and responsible adult capable of self-sustained continuous learning. That's my joy as a teacher currently teaching at Lagoons.",

I take my time to understand the strengths and weaknesses of my students and strategically formulate means to tackle them. I'm a distinction student and I can handle all levels of students. I have over the years built capacities and transformed students individually and helped to reach their goals.\n\n3. I like to teach in a serene environment that allows easy flow of information. I'm a proficient data analyst and computer literate. I have over the years adapt myself with recent technological trend in both local and international examinations. I give all my lectures off hand as a demonstration of strength to my students which has over the years made them better with the thought of emulating such.",

          "The only time I never had a distinction in Mathematics was during my first term in SSS1. That was because I joined the school during the 4th week, but then I still had the highest score. While in Primary school, I discovered a procedure for determining multiples of any number between 1 and 10, except 7 (which I had to read about years later). I was already reading Engineering Mathematics by K A Stroud while in JSS3.\nI taught an Ireland-based Nigerian girl who was preparing for SAT. Today, she's in the United States, having made her result excellently.\nI currently teach Further Mathematics, which is definitely an upgrade to General Mathematics. Interestingly, some of the topics in the Further Mathematics curriculum are being added to that of General Mathematics.\nWhen I teach, my goal is that my students understand what they are learning. If I have to teach a prerequisite topic, I do, because I really want them to know. Mathematics as a subject requires some level intuition. It's natural. Sometimes, I have to cite practical examples, if necessary, to pass the intended message.\nAll I require of my potential student is interest in and willingness to know Mathematics.",

He wanted to be able to speak up in class and also excel in his studies when he finally moves abroad. \n\nI learnt how to speak German in Germany. I understand that it is harder if you are outside of the country and of course everyday life circumstances comes in between.\n\nI would like to bridge that gap for you. If you are already experienced with the German Language we will only speak German. If you are a fresher I am glad to switch in between. Whatever works best for you to become better in the Language.\n\nI enjoy conversing. Talking about your everyday life and why you are learning German because at the end of the day all this is necessary to describe your experiences to others speaking the language.",

For example, general math has courses like A.P and G.P( in series and sequences) but further math goes ahead to treat convergence problems.\n\nIn times past, I have taught students in both junior and senior secondary classes who have struggled with understanding mathematics and they have gone on to write their JSSCE, WAEC and/or NECO and have passed.\n\nMy style of teaching includes establishing foundation topics in math before going further to further math questions or problems.\n\nI encourage every student to read through his/her notes and the topic to be discussed before each class, come to class with writing materials and a calculator, turn off every distraction including phones and participate in class well as show respect for the class.\n\nA well lighted and airy space, table(s) and chair(s), and a whiteboard maker will help make the class comfortable and condusive for learning.",

        "I am an experienced teacher of mathematics and have been grooming students to love/appreciate numbers, making them learn maths and other numeric skills passionately. I teach by first of all making students to understand that mathematics is the simplest subject because it deals with facts and has a pattern, which could be logic oriented, formula or our common day to day examples of numbers, items and countable transactions. With this, they are always relaxed and secondly I understand the problem areas in the subject so I know the exact weak areas children face and I hit it squarely by throwing questions in those areas, giving assignments and responding to that by a way of assessment.\n\nIn fact, NewHall Internaational School Chevron, Lekki, where I teach, organizes after class periods for some average pupils, my participation in that class has been having a positive multiplier effect as my pupils/students record tremendous improvements which far outweighs past numeric abilities.\n\nFinally, I teach by connecting the known with what is not yet known to the students, this enables them to understand better any explanation. Also as a Montessori/IGCSE trained teacher I adopt numerous teaching methods that befits different learning categories. This has been giving me the desired results expected.",

        "Dear Client,\n\nThank you for visiting my profile. Here are a few reasons why I'm the best available hand for your ward:\n\n1. General Mathematics teaches more than mere calculations, but equally, help students to develop analytical minds. If this is not gotten right at this level, a not so smart adult may result. Hence, it is important that an experienced and patient Tutor who will deploy an illustrative mode of teaching, to ensure that it is not only understood but enjoyed by the student. Having taught this for at least 3years at basic school level(primary and secondary), I believe I'm more than qualify to deliver.\n\n2. Not only have I taught for 3years, but I have also been able to achieve impressive results with my students. One of such is the Mosunmola who moved from hating Mathematics to loving it, and eventually had an A in Junior WAEC, after her parents had given up on her poor run of form in the subject.\n\n3. My relationship with my students goes beyond a pen and notepad. I do ensure that I become their friends, this makes me approachable, so they can easily inquire of me when they are having difficulty understanding what they are being taught. I deploy illustrative analogies to aid the learning process of my pupils and make the atmosphere less tense and friendly.",

I use modern teaching aids and techniques when tutoring my students, and also relate each concept to their daily experiences so they can understand and retain the knowledge better.\n\nI teach the major subjects for Years 1-6 such as English Language, Quantitatives, Mathematics, Creative & Letter Writing, Verbal Reasoning, ICT etc., as well as coach students in preparation for Common Entrance and secondary school exams, and have recorded great successes. In teaching young learners, I try to understand how best they learn and then tailor the lessons to suit them, while making emphasis on areas they may not have thoroughly understood.\n\nI am passionate about teaching. I strive to help my students master their numeracy, reasoning and vocabulary, including written and spoken English which are very important parts of training a pupil/student into a creative, analytical and responsible adult capable of self-sustained continuous learning. That's my joy as a teacher currently teaching at Lagoons.",

        "The only time I never had a distinction in Mathematics was during my first term in SSS1. That was because I joined the school during the 4th week, but then I still had the highest score. While in Primary school, I discovered a procedure for determining multiples of any number between 1 and 10, except 7 (which I had to read about years later). I was already reading Engineering Mathematics by K A Stroud while in JSS3.\nI taught an Ireland-based Nigerian girl who was preparing for SAT. Today, she's in the United States, having made her result excellently.\nI currently teach Further Mathematics, which is definitely an upgrade to General Mathematics. Interestingly, some of the topics in the Further Mathematics curriculum are being added to that of General Mathematics.\nWhen I teach, my goal is that my students understand what they are learning. If I have to teach a prerequisite topic, I do, because I really want them to know. Mathematics as a subject requires some level intuition. It's natural. Sometimes, I have to cite practical examples, if necessary, to pass the intended message.\nAll I require of my potential student is interest in and willingness to know Mathematics.",

Not only do I have a perfect grasp of Mathematics, I also have a unique ability to demystify the subject and make students realise it is not as hard as they think.\r\n\r\nI have helped many students improve their Mathematics grade tremendously and I have helped many pass external Mathematics exams they had previously failed within a few weeks of tutoring them for the exam. I can help your already performing child to excel at the subject even better and I can help your child with severe difficulties and perhaps phobia for mathematics overcome them in a very short time.\r\n\r\nI have developed an effective system of navigating through the General Mathematics Syllabus and helping the student understand every topic with the ability to solve even the toughest questions in record time. \r\n\r\nTrust me to give you all you require in a General Mathematics Tutor.

          "I am a graduate of Petroleum Engineering from the university of Port Harcourt with over three (3) years experience teaching Mathematics and Further maths. Within this short period of time, I have, through tutoring facilitated the success of scores of students in various National and international examinations like JSCE, WAEC, NECO, JAMB, IGSCE, and SAT. \r\n\r\nMy passion for teaching Mathematics derives from my love for solving problems, which in this case is putting an end to the abysmal performances of students and ensuring stellar results in Mathematics, particularly. \r\n\r\nHowever, imparting knowledge is often difficult when your student lacks the drive to learn. Therefore, my approach to upturning this has involved: first off, stimulating interest in the subject (or topic) by for example, exposing the tutee to the real life application (of that topic in question) in everyday events. This will among other benefits, create a sense of the indispensability of its knowledge (fortunately true in all cases), and how having a firm grasp of it makes her a potential problem solver. With this, interest should be piqued, then I can proceed to introducing core areas of the subject, focusing on breadth first, followed by depth: where my teaching expertise will come in handy in keeping you engaged, curious and motivated.\r\n\r\nSuccess is scarcely a product of blind luck and wishful thinking. To achieve it, one must be prepared to take on a challenge when it presents itself. The decision to excel backed up by preparation (or preparedness) is a combination that has proven to be effective time and again. Understanding mathematics for everyday application and/ or for acing that exam now hangs in the balance of how fast you decide to reach out to me. Call me, and let's make it happen!",

          "Are you thinking of hiring a tutor that can teach and mentor your child in Mathematics to achieve academic excellence and fulfill his/her future ambition? Interestingly, you are in the right place with the right tutor.\r\n\r\nI bagged an MSc. in Mathematical Science from the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences-Senegal (Full Scholarship) and a BSc. in mathematics at the University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria. I have acquired three years of teaching training at Oyo State College of education prior to my University education. I have more than a decade of teaching experience in Mathematics/Further Mathematics.  Teaching mathematics from simple to complex, concrete to abstract, and theory to practical is my unique style of tutoring.\r\n\r\nMy teaching abilities have inspired children and adults both in Nigeria and abroad (Senegal) to increase their analytical skills in solving problems. Some of the students that pass through my pen are now graduates of mathematics besides having distinctions and credit in IGCSE, Checkpoint, WAEC, NECO among exams. \r\n\r\nI can offer you or your ward all that is needed to achieve excellence and also get prepared for future challenges. I teach with skills, passion, morals, and good hygiene.",

One interesting thing about the subject that it helps one to think outside the box, making the students profer solutions to problems. I’m familiar with the topics ranging from Word problems, Algebra, Trigonometry, Statistics, Geometry, etc. \r\n\r\nI’ve helped students achieved success in examinations from the Primary level to Junior Secondary and Senior Secondary level. Also, I’ve made students come to love the subject as it has helped them improved their thinking and rational ability. \r\n\r\nI ensure that my students follow through when I teach. I encourage my basic students to be well versed in the multiplication tables knowing it by heart. I also employ mind-stimulating measures, assignments, and use of past questions.\r\n\r\nHire me, and let's make Mathematics fun and exciting for your child.",

          "I have a great flair for Mathematics and I have been fortunate to pass the subject with distinctions all through. My passion for the subject led me to take up an engineering course in the University and I have never regretted it one bit. It has been a success all the way and I am grateful to God for that. However, I can confidently say that my success story is a result of the zeal and effort I dedicated to learning Maths pretty well at the early stage of my education when I was a bit shaky at the subject. It surely paid off in bountiful fold. \r\n\r\nMy experience in teaching Mathematics for over 5 years now is such a beautiful one. I have about a 100% success rate with tutoring Mathematics as nearly all the students I taught bagged distinctions in it at their various standard examinations. A few exemptions to about 5-10% of my students who were probably unable to get distinction in it, but surely scored greatly above the average pass mark. In essence, there is no one student I will tutor in Maths that would not pass well in his/her examination. It is just not possible. However, I look beyond just passing examinations. I look forward to raising Mathematics geniuses as I am or even greater.\r\n\r\nI am a skillful tutor and my mode of teaching varies significantly as it solely depends on the learning ability of the student which varies for all. Irrespective, one thing is certain. Any student whom I tutor Mathematics would not only pass the subject well but also learn to appreciate the subject better. More like creating a bond between Mathematics and my student.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your kind consideration.",

          "Being highly proficient in both spoken and written English is achievable whether one is an  English as a second language speaker (ESL) or not. It takes determination and persistent to gain understanding and work at improving oneself with the basic skills of English language communication. I can attest that the English language is important and yet fun to learn.   \r\n\r\nDuring my course of studying in the University of Benin for a B. A in English and Literature, I had at one time been troubled about how I could gain mastery in a second language like English, but in due time, I grew to love speaking and also expressing myself through writing in the English Language. I have written some papers and projects that unusually love to share with the children I teach, this helps support their learning journey.\r\n\r\nOver the years as a teacher, I have taught and engaged students in English language study focusing on the four fundamental skills of language learning;  LISTENING,  SPEAKING,  READING AND WRITING. \r\n\r\n For the older children, together we have developed skills and theorems with objectives so as to always stand out in their English language communication. My students were candidates for internal examinations and external exams like; JSSCE, WASSCE, GCE, NECO, UTME (JAMB ). I always receive success reports after these lessons and coaching because of the application of the right English communication skills that I have taught them.\r\n\r\nFor the younger children, we treat the English language as fun, applying the right principles and getting better results with spelling, grammar, comprehension, reading, writing and speaking. We use a lot of sound drills and dictionary use and reading. We also keep a writing portfolio of our new words and pieces of writing. I bet you want your children to experience fun with learning the English language. \r\n\r\nI am available to join you support your child's learning journey.",

          "Dear Clients,\r\n\r\nDo you need a tutor that can help you or your child(ren) to improve  in speaking, writing, listening and reading?. Interestingly, you are in the right place with the right tutor.\r\n\r\nHere are the rationales for which you need to hire me.\r\n\r\nI bagged Msc Mathematical Science at African Institute for Mathematical Sciences-Senegal (Full Scholarship) and Bsc mathematics at University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria. \r\n\r\nThough l studied mathematics, but English language is a dynamic language l have taken much time to study. During my masters degree, l tutored colleagues from Francophones just to improve their communication skills.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, not only that I have adequate knowledge of subject matter (English) but also make sure learners get a clear picture of what each concept entails and how it is applicable in day-to-day activities. My teaching abilities have inspired children and adults both in Nigeria and abroad (Senegal).\r\n\r\nCurrently, l tutor Verbal section of GRE in a WhatsApp group which comprises Analytical writing skills, Sentence Completion and Comprehension.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, I always consider that learning and knowledge acquisition of a child takes multidimensional approach. For this reason, I love to teach at the child learning pace and try to understand him/her psychologically so as to know the best approach in making learning interesting.\r\n\r\n I have motivational and reinforcement strategies in encouraging my students. I always motivate learners to overcome phobophobia of learning. Most importanty, the best way to learn English is to lay off shyness and to always speak, write , listen and read especially via online platform.\r\n\r\n In recapitulation, I can offer your ward what will prepare him/her to achieve excellent academic performance and also get prepared for future challenges. I teach with skills, passion, moral and good hygiene. I always love follow-up and feedback messages beyond the schedule.",

          "I am a political scientist and lawyer in equity with a deep knowledge in English Language and have taught the subject for over 8 years. To make the subject easy and fun for my students I have devised a formula which I call PWSS. This helps me to properly breakdown the four major aspects of English viz Phonetics, Words, Syntax and Semantics. Having taught and prepared students for exams for several years, at least 60% of my test and assignment questions often come out in the exams.\r\n\r\nWhenever I resume lectures with my students, I begin with a test to find out the level of competence of the student i.e. average, below average or above average. This is to determine the best teaching approach to be adopted. I give regular assignments which may also include motivational exercises because some students challenges are in the mind not in the head; thus we work on both simultaneously.\r\n\r\nOver the years, my students have performed exceptionally well in their various classes and exams, collectively and individually. I have taught English Language in conventional schools and tutorial centers for over 8 years with excellent success rates. These claims are verifiable through my profile.\r\n\r\nI am a motivator, a friend, and a teacher. I cannot wait to get a call from you. Even the best can be better. God bless.",

          'English is an interesting language to read, write and communicate with. Moreover, it is the official language in Nigeria. My experience in the English Language dates back to the "Queen Premier", "Brighter Grammar" elementary days where the rudiments of the language are encoded in a child, and then to the Senior Secondary Schooldays of "A-1 English" and "A-Z Jamb". I enjoy learning and teaching the English language because one gets to learn new words and improve one\'s vocabulary and verbal prowess.\r\n\r\nI\'ve helped students gained mastery of the language in communicating with people. I\'ve also prepared students for Junior and Senior Secondary School Examinations and their results have been outstanding. I employ the use of Dictionary in every learning session making the students learn at least 10 new words meanings and applications per week. I engage in oral and written tasks as the lesson progresses. I also employ the use of past questions and ensure students understand the different aspects like Comprehension passage, Summary, Essay, and Letter Writing, Lexis and Structure, etc.\r\n\r\nThe English language is a very interesting language. Hire me today, and watch your child improve tremendously!',

          "As an English Language graduate, I have had several experiences teaching students. I teach the comprehension, composition, creative writing, Grammar, Oral English, and Literature in English. I also teach how to avoid seemingly common errors in the English language.\r\n\r\nI help in improving my student's handwriting as it may come as a surprise that most secondary school students struggle with legible writing, I assist in helping them make their writing clear and readable. I ensure that I establish a cordial relationship with my student as I have observed that a child becomes free, eager to learn, and attentive with someone he or she is comfortable with. This also encourages them to seek help if any topic or subject is unclear to them.\r\n\r\nI also teach to greatly improved the language skills of my student through thorough practice which will instill in them the courage, confidence, and ability to participate in any debates, oral presentation, and public speaking.\r\n\r\nMy unique style of teaching includes involving my students in the teaching process. The student-teacher learning method produces amazing results as it gives the student ample opportunity to contribute to the learning process while also learning.",

A graduate of biology education coupled with a teaching certification from the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria. \r\n\r\nI have undertaken a course from Alison on effective communication for teachers as I learned all the rudiments of effective communication.  I have taught English for a year in primary school as I am also a literary coach at Bookworm Cafe for two years now where pupils are taught and groomed for effective reading skills.  During the course of teaching English, over 70 percent of success was recorded.\r\n\r\nMy lessons are very simplified as I ensure I get the maximum attention of the pupil. For easy understanding, I make use of everyday examples around us. Also, I ensure that the pupil is being taught the foundation of reading through a proper understanding of the sounds of each alphabet as well as exposing the child to the basics of sentence composition. To evaluate the understanding abilities of the pupils, assignments are given and marked, feedback is given to the pupil, and with this, the pupil can be sure he/she is academically sound in each of the topics. For each of the lessons, all the necessary stationaries should be provided such as exercise books, textbooks, pens/pencils, and amongst others. I would prefer that the child is free from any disturbance and you can be sure that your child will perform every well above your expectations as parents.",

Although English is something almost everyone is quite conversant with since it is a global language, but it can be very tricky as well. Hence my drive to take up the challenge of ensuring my student(s) gets the best of it by deeply understanding its ethics, terminologies, and usage. My flair for the subject is a very astonishing one. I was able to get distinctions in all my English O'level courses owing to the painstaking efforts I put into it. That height boosted my expertise in the course.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have been teaching the subject well for about 6 years now (even before I graduated from secondary school) and I have been able to impact substantial knowledge to my students as it has enabled them to get excellent results in their respective examinations.\r\n\r\nConclusively, my style towards teaching is categorized by its uniqueness, vigorousness, and dynamism. I ensure a friendly and interactive environment for teaching as it helps sets my students in high spirits for learning, however, discipline and patience would be employed where and when necessary. I test my student(s) routinely to ensure they are following up effectively and meeting up to expectations.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your kind patronage.",

          "Biology is the natural science that studies life and living organisms, including their physical structure, chemical processes, molecular interactions, physiological mechanisms, development and evolution.Biology is divided into three broad areas of expertise, including the study of plants, the study of microorganisms and the study of animals.\r\nBiology was one of my core science subjects in secondary school. It was a subject i had always performed well as a pupil highly motivated to become a successful scientist. All my science subjects were of paramount interest to me during study time. As a result my performance was always above average.\r\nThis gave me the opportunity to teach basic science at junior level and biology at senior secondary school level. My students have always passed with good grades in this subject and I have equally mentored pupils into studying medicine & surgery in the universities.\r\nBiology is a subject tutored by discussion and practical demonstration. These involves introducing the topic, teaching/explanation, using drawings of plants, microorganisms, and animals/human physiology for practical demonstrations. Questions are asked by the students for the teacher to answer; further explanations are given, and the teacher can also ask the students questions to ascertain the knowledge gained. The students are given theoretical or practical class work and home work for further practice. Essential materials such as textbooks, notebooks, writing materials and if possible whiteboard and marker be made available.",

Also, I’ve made students come to love the subject as it has helped them appreciate the world of science more. \r\n\r\nI ensure that my students follow through when I teach.  I also employ mind-stimulating measures, assignments, and the use of past questions. I also employ the use of diagrams, specimens, and practicals to make the subject more appreciable.\r\n\r\nHire me, and let's make Biology the best subject for your child.",

        "Many times, students write like they speak. It is important to understand the difference. Many people make mistakes in their spoken and written English and the overall usage of words. Many times, because of the reading culture, the vocabulary level of many students is low and this affects their approach to questions and their general performance.\r\n\r\nI have had to teach various students and pupils who had to sit for different exams at various levels. I have to come discover that each child has his/her own peculiar challenges irrespective of the factors and forces around. Helping them to overcome such challenges has been the main point of my teaching style.\r\n\r\nI strongly believe in developing the habit of reading. I also help the child to learn how to understand the question, articulate his points, develop a writing pattern, while paying close attention to very basic but vital parts of writing. Some of these include: punctuation, tenses, legibility and cohesion. \r\n\r\nI usually like to start by assessing the student on what he/she knows. This usually helps me determine the intensity, scope of coverage and areas of emphasis of the teaching.\r\n\r\n",

I believe that the more you read, the better your written English gets. I make them write essays on a weekly basis and with correction and guidance, they improve at essay writing. I cultivate in them in them a love for writing by introducing them to a world of books.",

        'I am one of those who is very passionate about people speaking and writing properly. Unfortunately, a lot of people, including graduates of higher institutions of learning, have issues with tenses, subject-verb agreement, creative writing etc. This is an issue that could have easily been solved right from the onset, the elementary school. \r\n\r\nI believe that practice makes perfect. How people speak tends to affect how they write. I always listen to how my pupils speak and correct them instantly if there is a mistake. Before this, I must have helped them understand the basic rules of concord, etc.\r\n\r\nI love the dictionary and I always insist that my pupils "befriend" their dictionaries. At any point in time, they should look up words whose spellings or meanings are not known by them.\r\n\r\nReading is key. I encourage my pupils to read. We carry out exercises on reading and comprehending what has been read. We take this step by step. It is one thing to read, it is another to understand what has been read.\r\n\r\nI believe pupils should learn to express themselves through writing. Using a mind map, I help a child build his writing ability.\r\n\r\nI totally derive joy when I see pupils who were having challenges in speaking or writing proper English become better. Learning English shouldn\'t be boring. It truly can be fun.',

I Have prepared over 10 students for the Common Entrance Examination, Junior WAEC, Senior WAEC, JAMB, Checkpoint exams, and IGSCE. \r\nI Was privileged to teach a young adult how to read, write and do summations for the first time in her life within six months. Taught phonics to students using the jolly phonics resource materials. Taught a pupil visiting Nigeria from Australia literacy and numeracy using the Australian curriculum.\r\n\r\nI have been able to prepare some students for the Checkpoint and IGSCE exams and they passed well.\r\nHave taught the English Language to special children [down syndrome and children with learning difficulties] and it was challenging but rewarding. So I'm sure that I can help your wards learn to read, write and seat for English language exams with speed and accuracy. \r\nI have come to love the project, research, inquiry and lecture method of teaching. Therefore, I teach with these teaching style most times. I teach children using different instructional materials. Books; Jolly phonics workbook, word bank, activity books. Checkpoint textbooks,Bond series textbooks, IGSCE textbooks e.t.c.\r\n\r\nFlashcard; alphabet, words, tenses flashcards e.t.c and other teaching aids.

Pupils' attributes or character defines the suitable method to be adopted in teaching them, so as a result, teacher should be able to use and manipulate various methods in teaching the subject.\r\n\r\nHiring me would be of great benefit to you or your ward/child.",

        "The English language, being the primary language spoken in Nigeria comes easy to me. I have taught over 200+ students using the language. I have taught English in primary and secondary schools as well as to private students hence I am confident in my ability to teach students grammar and syntax, structure, punctuation, and sentence elements.\r\n\r\nI have watched a lot of my students pass both internal and external examinations. Thanks to the method of repetition and tons of examples which I use to make sure each student understands what they are being taught. I can remember helping some primary 5 students prepare for their common entrance exams. in one month, I was able to pull out A's as opposed to C's and D's they were having when I conducted an initial test on them.\r\n\r\nIf my student is preparing for an exam, I do well to review lots of past questions after every topic taught to acquaint the student with the pattern used by the examiner. \r\n\r\nI am result-oriented and whatever goal you have for your child, let's achieve it together.",

        "The English language is one of the most important subjects ever! It serves as a foundation for all other subjects and is required at all levels of education in Nigeria. \r\n\r\nMy first experience learning English was in Mind builders primary school and even as little as I was, I knew I was getting an amazing foundation\r\n\r\nMy skills in the English language make me a perfect fit to help your child to create this excellent foundation in the English language. I've written English in GCE (A), Senior WAEC (B), SAT (600), JAMB, and other exams. I've always been exceptional at English achieving parallel As across different levels. I've taught the English language to friends and students who have required my help and assisted with their English language assignments and essays several times getting excellent results!\r\n\r\nMy teaching style is usually tailored to each student, catering to their respective strengths. I start with an assessment test and then create goals based on the results. I communicate these goals with my students in order to ensure we achieve them together. I also like to establish rapport with my students, so I am neither perceived as mean nor too friendly. I also want to know what exactly the parent expects of me at the end of the teaching period.\r\n\r\nIn lessons, I take my time to breakdown the topics and then I give a lot of practice work to the student, both lesson work and homework. I like my students to have a quiet learning environment devoid of distraction with enough writing materials provided such as notebooks, workbooks, etc.",

        "The English language is a great tool for communication and as such, I am ever ready to impact the knowledge to the pupils. A graduate of biology education coupled with a teaching certification from the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria. \r\n\r\nI have undertaken a course from Alison on effective communication for teachers as I learned all the rudiments of effective communication.  I have taught English for a year in primary school as I am also a literary coach at Bookworm Cafe for two years now where pupils are taught and groomed for effective reading skills.  During the course of teaching English, over 70 percent of success was recorded.\r\n\r\nMy lessons are very simplified as I ensure I get the maximum attention of the pupil. For easy understanding, I make use of everyday examples around us. Also, I ensure that the pupil is being taught the foundation of reading through a proper understanding of the sounds of each alphabet as well as exposing the child to the basics of sentence composition. To evaluate the understanding abilities of the pupils, assignments are given and marked, feedback is given to the pupil, and with this, the pupil can be sure he/she is academically sound in each of the topics. For each of the lessons, all the necessary stationaries should be provided such as exercise books, textbooks, pens/pencils, and amongst others. I would prefer that the child is free from any disturbance and you can be sure that your child will perform every well above your expectations as parents.",
