I also believe in engaging in regular, continuous mental drills especially in the aspect of basic numeracy and arithmetic principles. For instance, having sound knowledge in the multiplication times table is of primary importance to me. \r\n\r\nI also believe in giving as many examples as possible until the pupil has gotten a firm grasp of the topic in question. I have a lot of testimonies to this effect, as many of the pupils I taught in primary schools are always willing to engage me when they get to secondary school. \r\n\r\nJust give me a trial and without doubt, you shall be convinced.",

I also end most lessons with questions or tests this enables me to know how much the student understands from the lesson.\r\n\r\nBasic Mathematics generally involves simple reasoning and calculations so when teaching I will concentrate on explaining the different topics,explaining lots of calculations on the different topics then setting questions to measure the students understanding.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience teaching students, I am certain this approach guaranties the student's success.

I have learnt the techniques and tricks of understanding Mathematics as a subject and the approach to passing exams and making good grades.\r\n\r\nDuring my service year, I helped my students understand the most scary topics because of my passion for the subject. I even wrote a poem to encourage them. I won several gifts in my primary school days. At undergraduate level, I have taken out time to study abstract topics in Mathematics and then subsequently teach my classmates. My knowledge of quantitative reasoning earned me good grades in common entrance and helped me pass several job aptitude tests with ease.\r\n\r\nMy teaching style involves first understanding my student's challenges, distilling the students' fears and helping them to discover the most convenient and quickest ways to understand questions and solve them without contravening the requirements of the teacher or the examiner.  \r\n\r\nI have helped my nephews and nieces, as well as several other pupils and students, understand topics that they did not understand from school.  That's my joy.\r\n\r\n",

        "Basic math as it is called is the building block to understand advanced mathematics. When the foundation is very strong, you can have the mightiest structure on it but if it is very weak, even a column will collapse on such foundation. Many students I have come across always attribute their mathematics flaws to the foundation by accusing the teacher involved.\r\n\r\nMy over 10 years’ experience in tutoring Mathematics generally has really helped me to understand the foundational topics and required skills associated with basic math and how to equip students better. I realize that to build a foundation, you need to build and develop student interest first. My teaching style is tailored to take my students through the foundation first before delving into some advanced areas for better understanding.\r\n\r\nI ensure that I explained every topic in the language of the student having in mind the time factor to solve the question.\r\nBasic Math involves understanding Operations in Mathematics, percentage, ratio, etc. I can make your child understand all this, hire me.",

Discussion method, brainstorming method, student-centered method are not exempted too. \r\n\r\nAfter taking note of student's weakness, in-depth analysis is then embarked upon.  I make sure I take note of individual learning styles and disabilities. This problem can be worked upon to improve the student's ability and knowledge about the subject matter.",

This is to say that I know my onions and I add value to every child I come in contact with. I love children and I have a passion for teaching and imparting into the lives and intellect of children. \r\n\r\nMy experience so far in teaching Mathematics has been amazing, I have taught children with different learning needs and also helped them to discover themselves. \r\n\r\nIn my teaching, I make my students understand the concepts and application of Mathematics. I make Mathematics look simple and interesting by breaking down the formula and steps in each topic in Mathematics. I also give as many examples as possible to guide them and build their confidence in the subject. Thereafter, they solve practical questions as classwork and homework. The results have always been impressive and there has always been recommendable feedback from parents on my teaching, and this has helped me through the process.\r\n\r\nIn teaching children, I make use of instructional materials and learning aids such as textbooks, printouts and electronic interactives like tablets. I also use different teaching methods based on the topic being taught. The interactive teaching method works best with me and I have seen measurable results. \r\n\r\nI love teaching Mathematics and I teach with the pre-knowledge that every student is different and each student has his or her distinct style of learning.",

        "My students always end up with a passion for mathematics and excellent grades after our teaching sessions. I introduce them to basic concepts on how to approach and solve any mathematical problem, and prepare them for any external exam like Common Entrance, UME, WAEC/NECO etc., and for international exams like IGCSE, Checkpoints. Students I have tutored always come out skilled such that they can help their peers with the subject.\r\n\r\nMy exceptional love and understanding for mathematics and further maths drives me to want to impact knowledge to others. I have taught students in primary, junior and senior secondary levels mathematics and further maths both as a school teacher and a home tutor and they always come out with outstanding results. My principle is that 'everybody can know it if they are taught' so I teach with that belief and it always works! I usually recommend helpful study materials to students, set assignments and equip them with enough knowledge to prepare them for standard exams. I look forward to tutoring you!",

        "I have tutored Mathematics up to GCSE level and A level over the last 7 years with greatly improved results.\r\n\r\nMy current students:\r\nGrade 9 (9 being the highest) for one of my pupils, in the new harder GCSE Maths exams, through setting exceptionally hard algebraic problems for GCSE.\r\n\r\nA* in IGCSE Maths for someone who was failing badly in Maths in Year 7, with 4 years of my tutoring and his efforts. He was doing Quadratics at the end of Year 8 with me, a huge transformation.\r\n\r\nGrade 6 (7 the highest) for IB Maths, having only been predicted a grade 3 with only 5 months of my tuition.\r\n\r\nI tutor pupils from many good schools like Day Waterman, Nigerian Turkish Int'l College, Vivian Fowler and so on. \r\n\r\nMy teaching methodology is gaining a firm understanding of the underlying concepts, which can often include going right back down to basics. To do this I combine interactive sessions with selected question sheets that build upwards from foundations. This may seem tedious but experience has taught me that its necessary to become present in the classroom again, where further tutoring wouldn't be needed.",

        "Having a solid foundation in Mathematics will help avoid the difficulties many students face in their later years, not only in Mathematics,  but in other subjects like Physics,  Chemistry,  Further-Mathematics,  Economics and much more. Studies have shown that understanding Mathematics from the basic level can help improve the Intelligence Quotient of an individual. \r\n\r\nAs an Engineering Graduate, I have taught numerous primary school pupils of all classes over the years both in a primary school and via private tutoring. I can assert that I have the skill, experience and passion it takes to give any child the necessary Mathematical background for any future endeavour.  I have been able to motivate already performing pupils to excellence and to also help those with difficulties in understanding mathematics overcome them. \r\n\r\nI start by assessing the child with mathematical drills to know what level of understanding he/she is at. I start from his/her level of understanding and help them rise to the level of an expert. I employ  the use of mental sums, adequate practice and a feedback system to ensure that I get the desired results. My aim for every pupil I teach is to understand Maths so well that they can become totally independent in handling the subject,  to the point of even teaching others. \r\n\r\nYou can count on me to give you all you need in a Maths tutor.",

        "Pupils see math as a major turn off which is not supposed to be so. A major challenge that I have noticed while teaching math is solving word problems. A good comprehension of the English used in such a problem is very key.\r\n\r\nFor pupils in the lower elementary, there are some fundamental things they must understand so that the learning of math would not be a challenge. For example, the multiplication table, capacity, weight and length tables, etc. Early assimilation of these key elements is vital.\r\n\r\nConstant testing or examination of the pupils is key. After every lesson, I  always give my pupils exercises to test their assimilation of the topic that has just been taught. If their performance is not encouraging, the lesson would be carried out again using a different method. \r\n\r\nTiming is so important. I encourage my pupils to always remember that no matter how good they are, they must always remember that they will be graded by how many correct answers they can give within a specified time. For this reason, we will carry out exercises to improve their working speed.\r\n\r\nMath can really be fun for your child.",

        "1. Basic mathematics refers to the basic concepts related to mathematics which generally involves counting, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This basis has to be gotten right to help students develop distinct analytical skills and in turn overcome all barriers in calculations. Hence, there is a need for a patient, flexible, versatile and experienced tutor to administer a detailed teaching pattern to your ward.  Having taught for over 6 years in the primary and JSS level, I can boldly say teaching your ward would meet up with your expectations.\r\n\r\n2. I have assisted students in acquiring a better understanding of the targeted topics or the subject as a whole by discerning the student's learning pattern and to know where to begin with for improved performance within a shortest possible time. A student of mine, Derin had a short-span attention ability but later improved from a grade D to a grade B student through my personalized teaching method.\r\n\r\n3.  Learning begins with acceptance. Therefore, I make it a point of duty to make myself easily accessible to my students, become their friend, constantly motivate them, deal with the individual on the basis of their strength. No child is dull, a little push makes a lot of difference.",

I specialize and major specifically in preparing pupils for major entrance examinations in mathematics such as Common Entrance Examinations, J.S.C.E Examinations, WAEC, NECO, JAMB, etc. Between 2003 -2006, I have prepared well over 120 pupils for Common Entrance Examinations into respective colleges of their choice and about 90 of them gained admission while the rest got enrolled in governmental colleges.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, I was declared BEST TEACHER OF THE YEAR in three successive years. I have also prepared pupils for competitions such as maths quiz, debates, etc. Recently I prepared some set of pupils at RIPE INT' SCHOOL SURULERE for a spelling bee competition and they got to semifinals. Between 2013 - 2016, I have prepared over 80 pupils for J.S.C.E Math Examinations and they all did very well. \r\n\r\nI have undergone numerous training in the teaching field such as \r\n1. A university degree in Mathematics Education.\r\n2. A certification in phonics and diction.\r\n3. I attended curriculum training at GRANGE SCHOOL IKEJA last year 2016.\r\n4. I was a key coordinator for this year's spelling bee etc.\r\n\r\nTeaching for me is a passion with a burning zeal to see every child succeed. I love and always embrace new challenges. I create a lasting impression of what I teach in the lives of my pupils. I usually make my pupils fall in love with mathematics. I present mathematics to them in the simplest way ever making the subject look like a playful thing. My motto is ''every child can learn and every child can succeed''.",

I have always had a flair for teaching Mathematics and volunteered severally as a tutor during my undergraduate years when I tutored 13 different students at different levels. \r\n\r\nIn my years as a professional tutor, I have privately tutored 21 secondary school students who showed marked improvement in their performance in school. I have also prepared 15 students for various exams such as Junior WAEC (BECE), SSCE (WAEC and NECO), IGCSE, UTME as well as SATs, most of whom aced their exams, despite a short time of preparation in some cases.\r\n\r\nI believe in a hands-on approach and I am very skilled at improving students' understanding, speed and confidence when solving problems.\r\n\r\nSo, I am confident I can help you or your wards master Basic Mathematics and get better grades in the subject. It's what I do, and I'll be happy to aid you or your wards toward success. \r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you.",

        "I am mathematics teacher with more than six (6) years of successful teaching experience. Understanding the curriculum perfectly has helped me in preparing students for examinations in which students made high grades. The topics of mathematics are not just been taught for students to make high grades only but to be able to relate each topic to day to day life activities.\r\nIn most cases, 75% of my students always make grade ‘A’ while 23% make B grade and 2% make C grade. This is as a result of my efficient method of teaching and motivation. Naturally my own success story motivates students to give in their best.\r\nThe method of teaching is simple and efficient. It is a form of closed system of teaching which requires a feedback mechanism. This varies depending on the mental ability of the student to be taught. The rudiment of the subject is reviewed briefly before proceeding to the core topics. This is done to ensure the student has a good background knowledge of the subject. At the end of each class; assignment is given. Sometimes, class work is given and at the end of the week; weekly test is done to serve as weekly assessment for the student(s). In conclusion, parents are expected to get the necessary course materials such as text books, past questions for the student(s) to facilitate effective learning and for the students to score high grade.",

        "Dear clients. Here are a few reasons why I am the right tutor for you.\r\n\r\n1. I am a first class graduate of mathematics and thus, have a good understanding of mathematics to a very satisfactory level. \r\n\r\n2. I am well experienced in teaching and tutoring, having taught students at various levels of learning (JSS, SSS, UTME and even undergraduates) at school, tutorial center, and homes. These experiences have laid bare to me the challenges faced by students in learning basic mathematics and equipped me with the necessary skills needed to impart meaningful knowledge to students. \r\n\r\n3. My teaching methodology involves assessing the student's basic analytical skills and understand where improvement is really needed. I understand every student's weakness varies and thus I tailor my teaching to suit the unique need of the student. Basic mathematics should be fun to learn and as such, I try to make learning mathematics fun to students while also producing results.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I build a cordial and professional relationship with my students to enable them to have an open mind to tell me where they need more clarification and also enjoy learning with a mind at ease. \r\n\r\nMy students' performances have always improved after their sessions with me. It's a really satisfying feeling for me to see my students excel in their school and external exams. \r\n\r\nA trial will surely convince you!",

        "A graduate of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the University of Lagos, Akoka. I have been teaching Basic Mathematics since 2009. Mathematics is the discipline that draws all conclusions. It is an interesting subject especially at the primary and secondary school levels, where mathematical concepts are basically concrete and easy to simplify.\r\n\r\nI love teaching Basic Mathematics because of the opportunity it serves me to build a very strong Mathematical Self-Efficiency Believes and Confidence in my students. A good foundation will certainly determine the overall strength of a structure.\r\n\r\nI have taught many students from different schools across Nigeria. Some were prepared for common entrance exams, junior secondary school certificate exams, NECO, WAEC, GCE, JAMB, IGCSE, and SAT, while others were tutored to succeed at school in Mathematics. \r\n\r\nHaving taught some students of Corona VI, Diamond Private School, Chrisland Ikeja, Lekki and VGC, Imperial Gate Lekki, Loyola Jesuit Abuja, Children International School Lekki, Atlantic Hall Lekki, St. Louisville College Ijebu-Ode, Whitesands School Lekki, Lagoon School Lekki, Meadow Hall Lekki, Heritage House Ikoyi, St. Rodger Manwood School London etc, I achieved great success in improving their abilities in solving mathematical problems and science related problems.\r\n\r\nI combine multiple teaching methods and instructional materials when grooming my students mathematics. From expository method to laboratory method, I skillfully switch from one style to another as the student's need arises.\r\n\r\nWhat my classes require majorly are conducive environment for learning, textbooks and other necessary instructional materials. I sometimes require a marker board for effective teaching and learning.",

Beginning with the efficient use of the multiplication tables and the use of BODMAS in knowing the order of operations as well as basic manipulative skills to get accurate results. Other areas such as algebra, geometry, fractions and the solving of equations is also made simple.\r\nI am a very passionate teacher of Mathematics. By the grace of God, I have taught students ranging from the primary to the secondary with amazing results. They have become inspired learners who can now study and attempt mathematical problems with little or no help.\r\nI love teaching so as to create  unquenchable drive for knowledge in the lives of the students in the most creative and friendly way!",

      description:
        "A self-taught Mathematician, I have spent more than half of my over six years of experience of teaching helping Primary School pupils move from the base of their respective classes to the top. \r\n\r\nI enjoy working with pupils who dislike Mathematics or consistently perform poorly because I used to be one of them. But with determination, and by going to the basis, I am now a passionate Mathematician. I have made successes too. One of them, Kabiru Aliu, used to have the least scores in his class; but within a year he was competing with the overall best student shoulder to shoulder. (The best person to lead your child to that desired goal is the one who is familiar with the terrain).\r\n\r\nBecause I understand the uniqueness of this set of pupils, I give them the most simplified approach and the patience required, as well as the confidence. I practically banish poor performance in Mathematics by mentoring, for I know how critical it is in shaping career interests, choice and opportunities. \r\n\r\nIf you want to make the fear of Mathematics or poor performance a thing of the past, or you want to make that child consider Mathematics his/her best subject, then you need Ademayowa. Remarkable improvement within a reasonable period is assured.",

        "I have had about 13 years of experience as a Mathematics teacher. I have discovered that most students hate the subject because of the approach of the teacher in the class. \r\n\r\nMathematics is very interesting if the teacher breaks the topic down and makes it practical for the children.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in teaching volume of solid shapes in my class, apart from starting with a good introduction by showing them a short interesting video that breaks down the topic, which of course helps lay the foundation for my lesson, I make sure I have the various shapes ready in the class and each of the shapes is enough in quantity to go round all my pupils. Therefore, we measure the edges of each shape and calculate the volume together. I also make sure we link the topic to other subjects and have group work. \r\n\r\nTo monitor the activities of my pupils at home, I make sure I register them on Google classroom which gives me the opportunity to interact with them irrespective of the distance. The result of this method of teaching is outstanding. Just within a term that I started using this method, 80% of my parents visited to appreciate the school and the teacher. I was personally happy when Oreva, one of my pupils started getting all her classwork right. I teach at Lara Day School, Ikeja and I handle Mathematics, Aptitudes, and Science in Grade 5.\r\n\r\nThere’s nothing mystical about Mathematics, it is more about the approach of the teacher. It is the same reason I want to assure you that if you employ me to assist your child at home, a better result is guaranteed and you can’t regret it.",

Math helps us think analytically and have better reasoning abilities. Analytical thinking refers to the ability to think critically about the world around us. Analytical and reasoning skills are important because they help us solve problems and look for solutions.\r\n\r\nI have been teaching pupils to excel in mathematics for the past 9 years. I have taught many pupils to pass mathematics in the Common Entrance Examinations and gain admission into secondary schools. \r\n\r\nMy style of teaching mathematics varies based on the way and pace the learner learns because it is known that learners learn at different paces. \r\n\r\nIn short, teaching mathematics should be more of a fun time rather than a burden.

I've always been one of the best students at maths, being naturally good at it in addition to studying and hard work.\r\n\r\nI completed WASSCE with A1 in mathematics and also took the SATS with my highest score being in math (over 82%) and earning scholarships with my result. It's safe to say Mathematics is my forte. I have taken various mathematics exams such as in JAMB and DIPLOMA entrance exams and aced my math each time.\r\n\r\nI've been called a good mathematics teacher a number of times. I'm told that I explain things well and I consciously put in the effort to do so. I've helped a few students prepare for school maths examinations and in addition to their inputs they've done really well.\r\n\r\nMy teaching style is usually tailored to each student, catering to their respective strengths. I start with an assessment test and then create goals based on the results. I communicate these goals with my student in order to ensure we achieve them together. I also like to establish rapport with my students, so I am neither perceived as mean nor too friendly. I also want to know what exactly the parent expects of me at the end of the teaching period.\r\n\r\nIn lessons, I take my time to breakdown the topics and then I give a lot of practice work to the student, both lesson work and homework. I also work with the school work and go through school assignments with the child. I like my students to have a quiet learning environment devoid of distraction with enough writing materials provided such as notebooks, etc.",

        "Many pupils are afraid of mathematics which it ought not to be so because mathematics is an everyday application in which without it we may be left behind. As a learner-centered teacher, I am ready to break the jinx and make the pupils fall in love with mathematics. \r\n\r\nBeing a basic mathematics teacher in primary school for a year has helped me in interacting with the pupils to understand their learning difficulties and differences. This has propelled me to go the extra mile in teaching the foundation of mathematics to the pupils and motivating them that mathematics is not to be feared.\r\n\r\nDuring my time of teaching, over 80% of the results were above average and satisfactory during the terminal examinations. This made the pupils have faith in themselves that anytime mathematics comes across their way, the results will be excellent.\r\n\r\nThe learner-centered approach is a method I use during my teaching in which the aims and objectives of each topic are tailored to the needs of each learner. Instructional materials are used such as pictures, chart,s and practical work are done which makes learning interesting. \r\n\r\nMy lessons are very simplified as I progress from the known to the unknown using everyday day examples for a better understanding of the lesson. Also, my teaching method is in dialogue form as the pupils and I interact and questions are asked and answered.\r\n\r\n Classwork will be given to the pupils to test their understanding of each topic and feedback will be given to improve the learning process. Also, the pupils or their parents can also give me feedback to improve the quality of teaching.",

Not only do I have a perfect grasp of Mathematics, I also have a unique ability to demystify the subject and make students realise it is not as hard as they think.\r\n\r\nI have helped many students improve their Mathematics grade tremendously and I have helped many pass external Mathematics exams they had previously failed within a few weeks of tutoring them for the exam. I can help your already performing child to excel at the subject even better and I can help your child with severe difficulties and perhaps phobia for mathematics overcome them in a very short time.\r\n\r\nI have developed an effective system of navigating through the General Mathematics Syllabus and helping the student understand every topic with the ability to solve even the toughest questions in record time. \r\n\r\nTrust me to give you all you require in a General Mathematics Tutor.

        description:
          "I am a graduate of Petroleum Engineering from the university of Port Harcourt with over three (3) years experience teaching Mathematics and Further maths. Within this short period of time, I have, through tutoring facilitated the success of scores of students in various National and international examinations like JSCE, WAEC, NECO, JAMB, IGSCE, and SAT. \r\n\r\nMy passion for teaching Mathematics derives from my love for solving problems, which in this case is putting an end to the abysmal performances of students and ensuring stellar results in Mathematics, particularly. \r\n\r\nHowever, imparting knowledge is often difficult when your student lacks the drive to learn. Therefore, my approach to upturning this has involved: first off, stimulating interest in the subject (or topic) by for example, exposing the tutee to the real life application (of that topic in question) in everyday events. This will among other benefits, create a sense of the indispensability of its knowledge (fortunately true in all cases), and how having a firm grasp of it makes her a potential problem solver. With this, interest should be piqued, then I can proceed to introducing core areas of the subject, focusing on breadth first, followed by depth: where my teaching expertise will come in handy in keeping you engaged, curious and motivated.\r\n\r\nSuccess is scarcely a product of blind luck and wishful thinking. To achieve it, one must be prepared to take on a challenge when it presents itself. The decision to excel backed up by preparation (or preparedness) is a combination that has proven to be effective time and again. Understanding mathematics for everyday application and/ or for acing that exam now hangs in the balance of how fast you decide to reach out to me. Call me, and let's make it happen!",

          "Mathematics is a very interesting topic. Mathematics was part of my core subjects from elementary school to 200L Undergraduate Pharmacy days. One interesting thing about the subject that it helps one to think outside the box, making the students profer solutions to problems. I’m familiar with the topics ranging from Word problems, Algebra, Trigonometry, Statistics, Geometry, etc. \r\n\r\nI’ve helped students achieved success in examinations from the Primary level to Junior Secondary and Senior Secondary level. Also, I’ve made students come to love the subject as it has helped them improved their thinking and rational ability. \r\n\r\nI ensure that my students follow through when I teach. I encourage my basic students to be well versed in the multiplication tables knowing it by heart. I also employ mind-stimulating measures, assignments, and use of past questions.\r\n\r\nHire me, and let's make Mathematics fun and exciting for your child.",

          "I have a great flair for Mathematics and I have been fortunate to pass the subject with distinctions all through. My passion for the subject led me to take up an engineering course in the University and I have never regretted it one bit. It has been a success all the way and I am grateful to God for that. However, I can confidently say that my success story is a result of the zeal and effort I dedicated to learning Maths pretty well at the early stage of my education when I was a bit shaky at the subject. It surely paid off in bountiful fold. \r\n\r\nMy experience in teaching Mathematics for over 5 years now is such a beautiful one. I have about a 100% success rate with tutoring Mathematics as nearly all the students I taught bagged distinctions in it at their various standard examinations. A few exemptions to about 5-10% of my students who were probably unable to get distinction in it, but surely scored greatly above the average pass mark. In essence, there is no one student I will tutor in Maths that would not pass well in his/her examination. It is just not possible. However, I look beyond just passing examinations. I look forward to raising Mathematics geniuses as I am or even greater.\r\n\r\nI am a skillful tutor and my mode of teaching varies significantly as it solely depends on the learning ability of the student which varies for all. Irrespective, one thing is certain. Any student whom I tutor Mathematics would not only pass the subject well but also learn to appreciate the subject better. More like creating a bond between Mathematics and my student.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your kind consideration.",

          "Being highly proficient in both spoken and written English is achievable whether one is an  English as a second language speaker (ESL) or not. It takes determination and persistent to gain understanding and work at improving oneself with the basic skills of English language communication. I can attest that the English language is important and yet fun to learn.   \r\n\r\nDuring my course of studying in the University of Benin for a B. A in English and Literature, I had at one time been troubled about how I could gain mastery in a second language like English, but in due time, I grew to love speaking and also expressing myself through writing in the English Language. I have written some papers and projects that unusually love to share with the children I teach, this helps support their learning journey.\r\n\r\nOver the years as a teacher, I have taught and engaged students in English language study focusing on the four fundamental skills of language learning;  LISTENING,  SPEAKING,  READING AND WRITING. \r\n\r\n For the older children, together we have developed skills and theorems with objectives so as to always stand out in their English language communication. My students were candidates for internal examinations and external exams like; JSSCE, WASSCE, GCE, NECO, UTME (JAMB ). I always receive success reports after these lessons and coaching because of the application of the right English communication skills that I have taught them.\r\n\r\nFor the younger children, we treat the English language as fun, applying the right principles and getting better results with spelling, grammar, comprehension, reading, writing and speaking. We use a lot of sound drills and dictionary use and reading. We also keep a writing portfolio of our new words and pieces of writing. I bet you want your children to experience fun with learning the English language. \r\n\r\nI am available to join you support your child's learning journey.",

          "Dear Clients,\r\n\r\nDo you need a tutor that can help you or your child(ren) to improve  in speaking, writing, listening and reading?. Interestingly, you are in the right place with the right tutor.\r\n\r\nHere are the rationales for which you need to hire me.\r\n\r\nI bagged Msc Mathematical Science at African Institute for Mathematical Sciences-Senegal (Full Scholarship) and Bsc mathematics at University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria. \r\n\r\nThough l studied mathematics, but English language is a dynamic language l have taken much time to study. During my masters degree, l tutored colleagues from Francophones just to improve their communication skills.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, not only that I have adequate knowledge of subject matter (English) but also make sure learners get a clear picture of what each concept entails and how it is applicable in day-to-day activities. My teaching abilities have inspired children and adults both in Nigeria and abroad (Senegal).\r\n\r\nCurrently, l tutor Verbal section of GRE in a WhatsApp group which comprises Analytical writing skills, Sentence Completion and Comprehension.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, I always consider that learning and knowledge acquisition of a child takes multidimensional approach. For this reason, I love to teach at the child learning pace and try to understand him/her psychologically so as to know the best approach in making learning interesting.\r\n\r\n I have motivational and reinforcement strategies in encouraging my students. I always motivate learners to overcome phobophobia of learning. Most importanty, the best way to learn English is to lay off shyness and to always speak, write , listen and read especially via online platform.\r\n\r\n In recapitulation, I can offer your ward what will prepare him/her to achieve excellent academic performance and also get prepared for future challenges. I teach with skills, passion, moral and good hygiene. I always love follow-up and feedback messages beyond the schedule.",

          "I am a political scientist and lawyer in equity with a deep knowledge in English Language and have taught the subject for over 8 years. To make the subject easy and fun for my students I have devised a formula which I call PWSS. This helps me to properly breakdown the four major aspects of English viz Phonetics, Words, Syntax and Semantics. Having taught and prepared students for exams for several years, at least 60% of my test and assignment questions often come out in the exams.\r\n\r\nWhenever I resume lectures with my students, I begin with a test to find out the level of competence of the student i.e. average, below average or above average. This is to determine the best teaching approach to be adopted. I give regular assignments which may also include motivational exercises because some students challenges are in the mind not in the head; thus we work on both simultaneously.\r\n\r\nOver the years, my students have performed exceptionally well in their various classes and exams, collectively and individually. I have taught English Language in conventional schools and tutorial centers for over 8 years with excellent success rates. These claims are verifiable through my profile.\r\n\r\nI am a motivator, a friend, and a teacher. I cannot wait to get a call from you. Even the best can be better. God bless.",

          'English is an interesting language to read, write and communicate with. Moreover, it is the official language in Nigeria. My experience in the English Language dates back to the "Queen Premier", "Brighter Grammar" elementary days where the rudiments of the language are encoded in a child, and then to the Senior Secondary Schooldays of "A-1 English" and "A-Z Jamb". I enjoy learning and teaching the English language because one gets to learn new words and improve one\'s vocabulary and verbal prowess.\r\n\r\nI\'ve helped students gained mastery of the language in communicating with people. I\'ve also prepared students for Junior and Senior Secondary School Examinations and their results have been outstanding. I employ the use of Dictionary in every learning session making the students learn at least 10 new words meanings and applications per week. I engage in oral and written tasks as the lesson progresses. I also employ the use of past questions and ensure students understand the different aspects like Comprehension passage, Summary, Essay, and Letter Writing, Lexis and Structure, etc.\r\n\r\nThe English language is a very interesting language. Hire me today, and watch your child improve tremendously!',

During the course of teaching English, over 70 percent of success was recorded.\r\n\r\nMy lessons are very simplified as I ensure I get the maximum attention of the pupil. For easy understanding, I make use of everyday examples around us. Also, I ensure that the pupil is being taught the foundation of reading through a proper understanding of the sounds of each alphabet as well as exposing the child to the basics of sentence composition. To evaluate the understanding abilities of the pupils, assignments are given and marked, feedback is given to the pupil, and with this, the pupil can be sure he/she is academically sound in each of the topics. For each of the lessons, all the necessary stationaries should be provided such as exercise books, textbooks, pens/pencils, and amongst others. I would prefer that the child is free from any disturbance and you can be sure that your child will perform every well above your expectations as parents.",

Although English is something almost everyone is quite conversant with since it is a global language, but it can be very tricky as well. Hence my drive to take up the challenge of ensuring my student(s) gets the best of it by deeply understanding its ethics, terminologies, and usage. My flair for the subject is a very astonishing one. I was able to get distinctions in all my English O'level courses owing to the painstaking efforts I put into it. That height boosted my expertise in the course.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have been teaching the subject well for about 6 years now (even before I graduated from secondary school) and I have been able to impact substantial knowledge to my students as it has enabled them to get excellent results in their respective examinations.\r\n\r\nConclusively, my style towards teaching is categorized by its uniqueness, vigorousness, and dynamism. I ensure a friendly and interactive environment for teaching as it helps sets my students in high spirits for learning, however, discipline and patience would be employed where and when necessary. I test my student(s) routinely to ensure they are following up effectively and meeting up to expectations.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your kind patronage.",

Through all these, I have achieved over 80% success with students I taught in the classroom and 100% success with students I taught privately. \r\n\r\nMy method involves teaching students the underlying principles in Biology, linking up topics, and giving so many examples as well. I also give the child a lot of Class works and assignments. I give them midway and monthly tests to determine their progress and know areas to improve on. \r\n\r\nI give a report or feedback back to the parents monthly so that both academically and otherwise a parent can know how his or her ward is fairing.",

          "Biology is the natural science that studies life and living organisms, including their physical structure, chemical processes, molecular interactions, physiological mechanisms, development and evolution.Biology is divided into three broad areas of expertise, including the study of plants, the study of microorganisms and the study of animals.\r\nBiology was one of my core science subjects in secondary school. It was a subject i had always performed well as a pupil highly motivated to become a successful scientist. All my science subjects were of paramount interest to me during study time. As a result my performance was always above average.\r\nThis gave me the opportunity to teach basic science at junior level and biology at senior secondary school level. My students have always passed with good grades in this subject and I have equally mentored pupils into studying medicine & surgery in the universities.\r\nBiology is a subject tutored by discussion and practical demonstration. These involves introducing the topic, teaching/explanation, using drawings of plants, microorganisms, and animals/human physiology for practical demonstrations. Questions are asked by the students for the teacher to answer; further explanations are given, and the teacher can also ask the students questions to ascertain the knowledge gained. The students are given theoretical or practical class work and home work for further practice. Essential materials such as textbooks, notebooks, writing materials and if possible whiteboard and marker be made available.",

Biology is a vast and interesting subject ranging from Human Biology, Physiology, Anatomy, Microbiology, Animal Biology, Plant Biology, etc. With a good knowledge of biology, one comes to appreciate life and health generally. As a pharmacist found expressions all through my University days in courses like Botany, Zoology, Anatomy, Physiology, Genetics, Microbiology, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Pharmacognosy, etc.\r\n\r\nI’ve helped students achieved success in examinations right from Junior Secondary, Senior Secondary, and University/Polytechnic levels. Also, I’ve made students come to love the subject as it has helped them appreciate the world of science more. \r\n\r\nI ensure that my students follow through when I teach.  I also employ mind-stimulating measures, assignments, and the use of past questions. I also employ the use of diagrams, specimens, and practicals to make the subject more appreciable.\r\n\r\nHire me, and let's make Biology the best subject for your child.",

I have learnt the techniques and tricks of understanding Mathematics as a subject and the approach to passing exams and making good grades.\r\n\r\nDuring my service year, I helped my students understand the most scary topics because of my passion for the subject. I even wrote a poem to encourage them. I won several gifts in my primary school days. At undergraduate level, I have taken out time to study abstract topics in Mathematics and then subsequently teach my classmates. My knowledge of quantitative reasoning earned me good grades in common entrance and helped me pass several job aptitude tests with ease.\r\n\r\nMy teaching style involves first understanding my student's challenges, distilling the students' fears and helping them to discover the most convenient and quickest ways to understand questions and solve them without contravening the requirements of the teacher or the examiner.  \r\n\r\nI have helped my nephews and nieces, as well as several other pupils and students, understand topics that they did not understand from school.  That's my joy.\r\n\r\n",

        "Basic math as it is called is the building block to understand advanced mathematics. When the foundation is very strong, you can have the mightiest structure on it but if it is very weak, even a column will collapse on such foundation. Many students I have come across always attribute their mathematics flaws to the foundation by accusing the teacher involved.\r\n\r\nMy over 10 years’ experience in tutoring Mathematics generally has really helped me to understand the foundational topics and required skills associated with basic math and how to equip students better. I realize that to build a foundation, you need to build and develop student interest first. My teaching style is tailored to take my students through the foundation first before delving into some advanced areas for better understanding.\r\n\r\nI ensure that I explained every topic in the language of the student having in mind the time factor to solve the question.\r\nBasic Math involves understanding Operations in Mathematics, percentage, ratio, etc. I can make your child understand all this, hire me.",

This is to say that I know my onions and I add value to every child I come in contact with. I love children and I have a passion for teaching and imparting into the lives and intellect of children. \r\n\r\nMy experience so far in teaching Mathematics has been amazing, I have taught children with different learning needs and also helped them to discover themselves. \r\n\r\nIn my teaching, I make my students understand the concepts and application of Mathematics. I make Mathematics look simple and interesting by breaking down the formula and steps in each topic in Mathematics. I also give as many examples as possible to guide them and build their confidence in the subject. Thereafter, they solve practical questions as classwork and homework. The results have always been impressive and there has always been recommendable feedback from parents on my teaching, and this has helped me through the process.\r\n\r\nIn teaching children, I make use of instructional materials and learning aids such as textbooks, printouts and electronic interactives like tablets. I also use different teaching methods based on the topic being taught. The interactive teaching method works best with me and I have seen measurable results. \r\n\r\nI love teaching Mathematics and I teach with the pre-knowledge that every student is different and each student has his or her distinct style of learning.",

        "My students always end up with a passion for mathematics and excellent grades after our teaching sessions. I introduce them to basic concepts on how to approach and solve any mathematical problem, and prepare them for any external exam like Common Entrance, UME, WAEC/NECO etc., and for international exams like IGCSE, Checkpoints. Students I have tutored always come out skilled such that they can help their peers with the subject.\r\n\r\nMy exceptional love and understanding for mathematics and further maths drives me to want to impact knowledge to others. I have taught students in primary, junior and senior secondary levels mathematics and further maths both as a school teacher and a home tutor and they always come out with outstanding results. My principle is that 'everybody can know it if they are taught' so I teach with that belief and it always works! I usually recommend helpful study materials to students, set assignments and equip them with enough knowledge to prepare them for standard exams. I look forward to tutoring you!",

Children with strong foundation in Mathematics when they were  in primary school always perform better than children with weak foundation. This makes the ones with strong foundation adapt easily to most subjects in secondary school. \r\nChildren whom I have taught this subject are known for  success and excellent results. This is because, I make Mathematics fun in learning and understanding. \r\nAs a graduate of Biology Education, I teach the children the best and easiest ways to solve mathematical problems according to their level. I teach a child based on his or her ability, I do not rush any child to learn, I believe in individual difference and slow and steady principle.

      description:
        "Having a solid foundation in Mathematics will help avoid the difficulties many students face in their later years, not only in Mathematics,  but in other subjects like Physics,  Chemistry,  Further-Mathematics,  Economics and much more. Studies have shown that understanding Mathematics from the basic level can help improve the Intelligence Quotient of an individual. \r\n\r\nAs an Engineering Graduate, I have taught numerous primary school pupils of all classes over the years both in a primary school and via private tutoring. I can assert that I have the skill, experience and passion it takes to give any child the necessary Mathematical background for any future endeavour.  I have been able to motivate already performing pupils to excellence and to also help those with difficulties in understanding mathematics overcome them. \r\n\r\nI start by assessing the child with mathematical drills to know what level of understanding he/she is at. I start from his/her level of understanding and help them rise to the level of an expert. I employ  the use of mental sums, adequate practice and a feedback system to ensure that I get the desired results. My aim for every pupil I teach is to understand Maths so well that they can become totally independent in handling the subject,  to the point of even teaching others. \r\n\r\nYou can count on me to give you all you need in a Maths tutor.",

For example, the multiplication table, capacity, weight and length tables, etc. Early assimilation of these key elements is vital.\r\n\r\nConstant testing or examination of the pupils is key. After every lesson, I  always give my pupils exercises to test their assimilation of the topic that has just been taught. If their performance is not encouraging, the lesson would be carried out again using a different method. \r\n\r\nTiming is so important. I encourage my pupils to always remember that no matter how good they are, they must always remember that they will be graded by how many correct answers they can give within a specified time. For this reason, we will carry out exercises to improve their working speed.\r\n\r\nMath can really be fun for your child.",

      description:
        "1. Basic mathematics refers to the basic concepts related to mathematics which generally involves counting, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This basis has to be gotten right to help students develop distinct analytical skills and in turn overcome all barriers in calculations. Hence, there is a need for a patient, flexible, versatile and experienced tutor to administer a detailed teaching pattern to your ward.  Having taught for over 6 years in the primary and JSS level, I can boldly say teaching your ward would meet up with your expectations.\r\n\r\n2. I have assisted students in acquiring a better understanding of the targeted topics or the subject as a whole by discerning the student's learning pattern and to know where to begin with for improved performance within a shortest possible time. A student of mine, Derin had a short-span attention ability but later improved from a grade D to a grade B student through my personalized teaching method.\r\n\r\n3.  Learning begins with acceptance. Therefore, I make it a point of duty to make myself easily accessible to my students, become their friend, constantly motivate them, deal with the individual on the basis of their strength. No child is dull, a little push makes a lot of difference.",

      description:
        "I am mathematics teacher with more than six (6) years of successful teaching experience. Understanding the curriculum perfectly has helped me in preparing students for examinations in which students made high grades. The topics of mathematics are not just been taught for students to make high grades only but to be able to relate each topic to day to day life activities.\r\nIn most cases, 75% of my students always make grade ‘A’ while 23% make B grade and 2% make C grade. This is as a result of my efficient method of teaching and motivation. Naturally my own success story motivates students to give in their best.\r\nThe method of teaching is simple and efficient. It is a form of closed system of teaching which requires a feedback mechanism. This varies depending on the mental ability of the student to be taught. The rudiment of the subject is reviewed briefly before proceeding to the core topics. This is done to ensure the student has a good background knowledge of the subject. At the end of each class; assignment is given. Sometimes, class work is given and at the end of the week; weekly test is done to serve as weekly assessment for the student(s). In conclusion, parents are expected to get the necessary course materials such as text books, past questions for the student(s) to facilitate effective learning and for the students to score high grade.",

        "Dear clients. Here are a few reasons why I am the right tutor for you.\r\n\r\n1. I am a first class graduate of mathematics and thus, have a good understanding of mathematics to a very satisfactory level. \r\n\r\n2. I am well experienced in teaching and tutoring, having taught students at various levels of learning (JSS, SSS, UTME and even undergraduates) at school, tutorial center, and homes. These experiences have laid bare to me the challenges faced by students in learning basic mathematics and equipped me with the necessary skills needed to impart meaningful knowledge to students. \r\n\r\n3. My teaching methodology involves assessing the student's basic analytical skills and understand where improvement is really needed. I understand every student's weakness varies and thus I tailor my teaching to suit the unique need of the student. Basic mathematics should be fun to learn and as such, I try to make learning mathematics fun to students while also producing results.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I build a cordial and professional relationship with my students to enable them to have an open mind to tell me where they need more clarification and also enjoy learning with a mind at ease. \r\n\r\nMy students' performances have always improved after their sessions with me. It's a really satisfying feeling for me to see my students excel in their school and external exams. \r\n\r\nA trial will surely convince you!",

      description:
        "I have always loved mathematics, and somehow found myself teaching the subject, I get sad with the response I get when I ask a child what they think about mathematics. During my masters, my research was in helping students become better in mathematics, with this I discovered that every child is unique in their own way, and by means should be approached differently. I use digital media and technology with anything practical, such as charts, cups, grains, papers, etc. to teach children basic mathematics. \r\n\r\nWhat can be more inspiring to the inquisitive mind of a child if he or she is taught to learn formulas by creating a mobile app that solves the problem. I have been using tech to teach struggling and advanced children mathematics, in one occasion the company I use to work for organized a Design Thinking competition, I worked closely with 7 children, to help them discover their strength, in the team there was a very timid boy who didn’t like numbers, but with LEGOS and robots around, he took interest and became the driving force of the team. My team won the competition because we were able to help one another locate our strengths and face our fears in a way that was more fun and interesting. Currently, I’m working as the Tech Lead of an NGO and I have supervisors I’m also working within to build a game-based solution that helps a child understand basic mathematics.\r\n\r\nDue to COVID-19, I have put in place preventive measures for parents that are concerned about tutors visiting their homes, with my pen tablet I can deliver math lessons online using a digital whiteboard. So I am very open to both virtual and physical lessons.",

Math teaching can be very rewarding if one knows how to adopt various teaching techniques in teaching it to encourage learners intellectual development. \r\n\r\nTo teach math, I don't limit myself to one teaching methods but make use of various method and select which is best to teach a particular learner.\r\n\r\nHiring me would be of great help to you or your ward/child.",

      description:
        "I have had about 13 years of experience as a Mathematics teacher. I have discovered that most students hate the subject because of the approach of the teacher in the class. \r\n\r\nMathematics is very interesting if the teacher breaks the topic down and makes it practical for the children.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in teaching volume of solid shapes in my class, apart from starting with a good introduction by showing them a short interesting video that breaks down the topic, which of course helps lay the foundation for my lesson, I make sure I have the various shapes ready in the class and each of the shapes is enough in quantity to go round all my pupils. Therefore, we measure the edges of each shape and calculate the volume together. I also make sure we link the topic to other subjects and have group work. \r\n\r\nTo monitor the activities of my pupils at home, I make sure I register them on Google classroom which gives me the opportunity to interact with them irrespective of the distance. The result of this method of teaching is outstanding. Just within a term that I started using this method, 80% of my parents visited to appreciate the school and the teacher. I was personally happy when Oreva, one of my pupils started getting all her classwork right. I teach at Lara Day School, Ikeja and I handle Mathematics, Aptitudes, and Science in Grade 5.\r\n\r\nThere’s nothing mystical about Mathematics, it is more about the approach of the teacher. It is the same reason I want to assure you that if you employ me to assist your child at home, a better result is guaranteed and you can’t regret it.",

        "Mathematics is a very interesting subject when you have the right teacher. Maths has always been one of my favorite subjects and my best opportunity to get 100%. I've always been one of the best students at maths, being naturally good at it in addition to studying and hard work.\r\n\r\nI completed WASSCE with A1 in mathematics and also took the SATS with my highest score being in math (over 82%) and earning scholarships with my result. It's safe to say Mathematics is my forte. I have taken various mathematics exams such as in JAMB and DIPLOMA entrance exams and aced my math each time.\r\n\r\nI've been called a good mathematics teacher a number of times. I'm told that I explain things well and I consciously put in the effort to do so. I've helped a few students prepare for school maths examinations and in addition to their inputs they've done really well.\r\n\r\nMy teaching style is usually tailored to each student, catering to their respective strengths. I start with an assessment test and then create goals based on the results. I communicate these goals with my student in order to ensure we achieve them together. I also like to establish rapport with my students, so I am neither perceived as mean nor too friendly. I also want to know what exactly the parent expects of me at the end of the teaching period.\r\n\r\nIn lessons, I take my time to breakdown the topics and then I give a lot of practice work to the student, both lesson work and homework. I also work with the school work and go through school assignments with the child. I like my students to have a quiet learning environment devoid of distraction with enough writing materials provided such as notebooks, etc.",

        "Many pupils are afraid of mathematics which it ought not to be so because mathematics is an everyday application in which without it we may be left behind. As a learner-centered teacher, I am ready to break the jinx and make the pupils fall in love with mathematics. \r\n\r\nBeing a basic mathematics teacher in primary school for a year has helped me in interacting with the pupils to understand their learning difficulties and differences. This has propelled me to go the extra mile in teaching the foundation of mathematics to the pupils and motivating them that mathematics is not to be feared.\r\n\r\nDuring my time of teaching, over 80% of the results were above average and satisfactory during the terminal examinations. This made the pupils have faith in themselves that anytime mathematics comes across their way, the results will be excellent.\r\n\r\nThe learner-centered approach is a method I use during my teaching in which the aims and objectives of each topic are tailored to the needs of each learner. Instructional materials are used such as pictures, chart,s and practical work are done which makes learning interesting. \r\n\r\nMy lessons are very simplified as I progress from the known to the unknown using everyday day examples for a better understanding of the lesson. Also, my teaching method is in dialogue form as the pupils and I interact and questions are asked and answered.\r\n\r\n Classwork will be given to the pupils to test their understanding of each topic and feedback will be given to improve the learning process. Also, the pupils or their parents can also give me feedback to improve the quality of teaching.",
